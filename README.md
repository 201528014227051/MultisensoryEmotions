# MultisensoryEmotions
Bio-inspired multi sensory emotions recognition



This repository presents three bio-inspired multisensory integration models 

- Integration by convergence : 


- Integration through cross-modal enhancement


- Integration through neural synchrony 


Some of of the code for SNN basic SNN implemention and parameters in this code is based on the model 

proposed by Diehl and Cook

The convolution architecture is  adaptated  from
