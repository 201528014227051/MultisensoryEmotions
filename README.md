# MultisensoryEmotions

Bio-inspired multi sensory emotions recognition



This repository presents three bio-inspired multisensory integration models 

- Integration by convergence : 


- Integration through cross-modal enhancement


- Integration through neural synchrony 


Some of of the code for SNN basic SNN architectures and parameters in this code is based on the model 

proposed by Diehl and Cook

The convolution architecture is  adaptated  from

Please note the the site is still under construction and more code will be added
